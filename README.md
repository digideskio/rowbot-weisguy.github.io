## Installation

Who knows?

Try using `nodes.js` or some kind of computer-tool. I like to use iTerm2.

## Getting Started

Take deep breaths.

It doesn't matter where you start, just start.

Never give up on your dreams.

Remember your training.

        But really, just clone this, use <code>npm install</code> to get the
        dependencies, and then <code>gulp</code> to build and serve the site.
