Hello! Welcome to the source for [@rowbot-weisguy](https://github.com/rowbot-weisguy)'s
personal website. Feel free to wander through the source. âœŒ

## Installation

Who knows?

Try using `nodes.js` or some kind of computer-tool. I like to use iTerm2.

## Getting Started

Take deep breaths.

It doesn't matter where you start, just start.

Never give up on your dreams.

Remember your training.

*But really, just clone this, use `npm install` to get the dependencies, and then `gulp` to build and serve the site.*
