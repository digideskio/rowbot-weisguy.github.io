It’s all fresh in here. I made a new site for myself!</p>\n\n<p>Welcome. 👋</p>\n\n<p>It’s going to be very straightforward. It’s going to be a place that\ndoesn’t suck for me to write my thoughts. It doesn’t depend on a feed\nalgorithm and I get to keep ownership. Perfect.</p>\n\n<p>The past few months I feel like I’ve just floated along on social media\nlike a cloud. I felt sad using it because I felt anonymous most of the time. I\nnever knew who I was reaching. I didn’t have any control.</p>\n\n<p>So I shrank for a while and introspected. 🍂</p>\n\n<p>But now it’s time to grow and share. 🌳</p>\n\n<p>Sharing things as I go along is my one promise for this blog. Oh, and adding some\nshort case studies on the work I’ve done in the past couple years. I’ve been a\nbit lazy about that. 🙈</p>\n\n<p>Shit… I may have to reinvent the party button, too. It’s missing for now. 😢</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, hope you’re having a good day! If ever you feel inspired and have a thought\nor comment to share, I’ve got comments just for you. See you around.</p>\n","url":"/blog/fresh-blog/"}
