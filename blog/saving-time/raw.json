They wrote it from the perspective of which super power they wish\nthey had that they could share with others. I loved Melinda‚Äôs section\nabout <em>time</em>.</p>\n\n<p>She writes about the unequal distribution of time spent on unpaid work and how\nit perpetuates gender inequality <em>everywhere</em> in the world. Then she shows how\nthe triangle kitchen design drastically reduced the number of steps required in\nthe kitchen for a person to bake a cake (as an example).</p>\n\n<p>The result of this design was that it created <em>new</em> time for women to participate\nin social and civic discourse.</p>\n\n<p>That‚Äôs what got me excited. The idea of creating new time for people to\nfocus on the things that are most important to them, where they can contribute\nthe most possible value to their communities.</p>\n\n<p>Right now we‚Äôre standing in front of a giant wave of new products and\nservices that will automate so many drudge tasks. It‚Äôs going to enable so\nmany new civic and social participants.</p>\n\n<p>Awesome!</p>\n\n","url":"/blog/saving-time/"}
