There are a bunch of <a href=\"//www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Future-of-Food\">smart people</a>\nthinking hard about how we can make <a href=\"//www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34540193\">meat production</a> a more <a href=\"//impossiblefoods.com/\">efficient process</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These companies tend to view meat the same way I do: as a product that is made\nby converting water and plant protein into animal proteins. If we‚Äôre talking\nabout livestock then this process additionally requires a significant amount of\nland.</p>\n\n<p>Not only that, but animals are terribly inefficient and slow at this conversion.\nIt takes around <a href=\"//foodtank.com/news/2013/12/why-meat-eats-resources\">~1800 gallons of water</a> to produce one pound of beef,\nthough the numbers on that one are hard to pin down since conditions for raising\nlivestock vary from place to place.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it‚Äôs a lot of water. It blew my mind when I learned how much water is\nrequired to grow the crops that feed the livestock, which in turn feeds us. At\nthis rate, it‚Äôs almost cute that we think putting a water ban on lawns will make\na difference.</p>\n\n<p>So although animals have served as great culinary inspiration for us, we‚Äôve\nlearned that they suck at turning land, food, and water\n(<a href=\"//www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity\">which is already scarce</a>) into meat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Livestock is an outdated technology\n‚Äî Patrick Brown</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This inefficiency gets me stoked. It‚Äôs good for both animals and for us. It gives us\nincentive to stop killing animals <em>and</em> make better use of Earth‚Äôs limited resources.\nWe‚Äôve pushed factory farming to its extremes and proved it won‚Äôt work, so now we‚Äôre\nforced to consider alternative production methods.</p>\n\n<p>This is necessary to keep up with the growth in demand for meat as economies around\nthe world strengthen. More people can afford meat. It‚Äôs a great example of\nhow constraints help to inspire innovation.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm excited to start eating <a href=\"//www.memphismeats.com/\">cultured meat</a>, or products like the\nBeast Burger created by <a href=\"//beyondmeat.com/\">Beyond Meat</a> (so cool, read about\n<a href=\"//www.outsideonline.com/1928211/top-secret-food-will-change-way-you-eat\">how its made</a>). The one thing I‚Äôm kind of annoyed about is that in Canada, these\nkinds of products aren‚Äôt as available yet.</p>\n\n<p>Fingers crossed that changes soon.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, since October I now have one simple rule that I follow: <strong>I don‚Äôt\nbuy food that was once an animal</strong>. I don‚Äôt vote with my dollars for animals to\nbe raised and slaughtered. I think it‚Äôs a dated approach to meat production with\nnegative impacts on our health and our environment.</p>\n\n<p>Besides, killing animals seems pretty shitty.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n\n","url":"/blog/evolving-past-killing/"}
