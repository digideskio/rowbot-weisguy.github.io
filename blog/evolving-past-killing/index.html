    <p>I’m excited about the future of food. There are a <a href="//impossiblefoods.com/">bunch</a> of
<a href="//beyondmeat.com/">smart</a> <a href="//www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Future-of-Food">people</a> <a href="//www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34540193">thinking</a>
<a href="//www.memphismeats.com/">hard</a> about how we can make meat production a more efficient
process.</p>

<p>These companies tend to view meat the same way I do: as a product that is made
by converting water and plant protein into animal proteins. If we’re talking
about livestock then this process additionally requires a significant amount of
land.</p>

<p>Not only that, but animals are terribly inefficient and slow at this conversion.
It takes around <a href="//foodtank.com/news/2013/12/why-meat-eats-resources">~1800 gallons of water</a> to produce one pound of beef.
The numbers on that one are hard to pin down since conditions vary so much.</p>

<p>Although animals have served as great culinary inspiration for us, I think by now
most of us can agree that they suck at turning food and water
(<a href="//www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity">which is already scarce</a>) into meat.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, this makes me happy. This is good for animals and for us. We
have incentive to stop killing animals while making better use of Earth’s limited
resources. We’ve pushed factory farming to its extremes and learned that it’s
just not all it’s cracked up to be.</p>

<p>I’m making light of it because I hate thinking of how <em>fucked up</em> some of the
videos I’ve seen are. Eugh_.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about how to participate in this movement, I have one simple
rule that I follow: don’t buy food that was once an animal.</p>

<p>I hesitate to call myself a true vegetarian for this reason, but I eat (for now)
a 99% vegetarian diet.</p>

<hr />

<p>Last week, I ordered a veggie burrito to-go and it ended up having beef in it.
Ugh. But I ate it. I figured it wouldn’t make any difference whether I brought
it back or not because it was destined either to feed me, or be thrown in the
garbage.</p>

<p>I’ve been on a 99% vegetarian diet since October. I eat meat once in a while if
I’m a guest and the meat is already cooked and served to me. I often don’t feel
like trying to convince other people to change – people take their diets very
seriously. My only rule is that I don’t purchase meat; I don’t vote with my
dollars for more animals to be raised and then slaughtered.</p>

<p>I chose to be vegetarian for very pragmatic ecological reasons: I don’t think
meat production scales well. We have evolved our agricultural processes to a
point that we can ensure everyone gets proper nutrition without having to eat
meat. In fact, we could produce several more times the amount of plant based
crops for human consumption if we didn’t use so much of it to feed animals.
When you consider global warming as a factor, hydrating mass amounts of
livestock is probably not the best use of water, either. The conversion of
land, water and plant protein into animal protein (raising livestock) is overall
a very inefficient process.</p>

<p>Meat is a luxury, not a necessity. I hear many people argue that we are naturally
omnivores. They say that we have always eaten meat even as primitive
hunter-gatherers. This says little to me except that many of us humans are
hesitant to evolve past killing. There are large agricultural corporations that
have vested interests in keeping animals as a regular food on our plates, eating
it in at least 2 meals a day. We’ll continue to see them do their marketing
accordingly.</p>

<p>The best way for meat to shift towards being seen for what it really is – a
luxury – is for the price to rise. At the same time, I’d like to see more great
meat alternatives come to market at competitive prices. To name a couple of the
cool advancements in this area: there’s companies like Beyond Meat (which uses
a machine that bundles plant fiber to have the texture of animal tissue) and
there’s lab grown meat, too. Once these options become more accessible while
regular meat becomes less accessible (read: expensive), we will be on a fast
track in the direction I mentioned earlier: evolving past killing.</p>

<p>I’m optimistic about the development of this industry over the next few years.
I think it’s an exciting time to be an informed consumer because you can be part
of an incredible shift in the food industry and humanity’s diet overall.
Technology, as with every other industry it touches, will help us get past this
ugly chapter in our history.</p>

<p>Anyway, after a few months of eating vegetarian I’ve become more interested in
the ethical side of vegetarianism. Last week, I ordered a veggie burrito to-go
and it ended up having beef in it. Ugh. But I ate it. I figured it wouldn’t make
any difference whether I brought it back or not because it was destined either
to feed me, or be thrown in the garbage. But I couldn’t enjoy it. I ended up
throwing half of it away and feeling terrible about the half that I ate. It
reminded of the cruelty and suffering that was required to produce it.</p>

<p>I watched this video and I cried, just like every other time I watch a video of
animals suffering. I wish that would be enough for people! But I think having a
vision for a better future is much more effective.</p>
