Do you smell that?

Neither do I. It's all fresh in here. I made a new site for myself!

Welcome. 👋

It's going to be very straightforward. It's going to be a place that
doesn't suck for me to write my thoughts. It doesn't depend on a feed
algorithm and I get to keep ownership. Perfect.

The past few months I feel like I've just floated along on social media
like a cloud. I felt sad using it because I felt anonymous most of the time. I
never knew who I was reaching. Plus I never had any control.

So I shrank for a while. 🍂

Time to grow, and to share ideas that nourish me. 🌳 That's my one promise at
the outset of this thing.

Oh, and I'll add some short case studies on the work I've done in
the past couple years. I've been a bit lazy about that. 🙈

Shit... I may have to reinvent the party button, too. It's missing for now. 😢

If something I write reminds you of something, feel free to share it in the
comments! That's what I put them there for.

Anyway, hope you're having a good day! See you around.
