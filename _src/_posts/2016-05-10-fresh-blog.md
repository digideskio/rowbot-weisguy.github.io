Do you smell that?

Neither do I. It's all fresh in here. I made a new site for myself!

Welcome. 👋

It's going to be very straightforward. It's going to be a place that
doesn't suck for me to write my thoughts. It doesn't depend on a feed
algorithm and I get to keep ownership. Perfect.

The past few months I feel like I've just floated along on social media
like a cloud. I felt sad using it because I felt anonymous most of the time. I
never knew who I was reaching. I didn't have any control.

So I shrank for a while and introspected. 🍂

But now it's time to grow and share. 🌳

Sharing things as I go along is my one promise for this blog. Oh, and adding some
short case studies on the work I've done in the past couple years. I've been a
bit lazy about that. 🙈

Shit... I may have to reinvent the party button, too. It's missing for now. 😢

Anyway, hope you're having a good day! If ever you feel inspired and have a thought
or comment to share, I've got comments just for you. See you around.
