Do you smell that?

Neither do I. It&rsquo;s all fresh in here. I made a new site for myself!

Welcome. 👋

This time around it&rsquo;s going to be a little more straightforward.
I want a place that doesn&rsquo;t suck to write thoughts. A place that
doesn&rsquo;t care about favourites or likes.

The past few months I feel like I&rsquo;ve just floated along on social media
like a cloud. I was sad with it and felt anonymous most of the time.

So I shrank for a while. 🍂

Time to grow, and to share ideas that nourish me. 🌳 That&rsquo;s my one promise at
the outset of this thing.

Oh, and I&rsquo;ll add some short case studies on the work I&rsquo;ve done in
the past couple years. I&rsquo;ve been a bit lazy about that. 🙈

Shit... I may have to reinvent the party button, too. It&rsquo;s missing for now. 😢

If something I write reminds you of something, feel free to share it in the
comments! That&rsquo;s what I put them there for.

Anyway, hope you&rsquo;re having a good day! See you around.
