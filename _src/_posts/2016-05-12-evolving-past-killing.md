I'm excited about the future of food. There are a bunch of [smart people][gates-future-food]
thinking hard about how we can make [meat production][mosa-meat] a more [efficient process][impossible-foods].

These companies tend to view meat the same way I do: as a product that is made
by converting water and plant protein into animal proteins. If we're talking
about livestock then this process additionally requires a significant amount of
land.

Not only that, but animals are terribly inefficient and slow at this conversion.
It takes around [~1800 gallons of water][water-beef] to produce one pound of beef,
though the numbers on that one are hard to pin down since conditions for raising
livestock vary from place to place.

Still, it's a lot of water. It blew my mind when I learned how much water is
required to grow the crops that feed the livestock, which in turn feeds us. At
this rate, it's almost cute that we think putting a water ban on lawns will make
a difference.

So although animals have served as great culinary inspiration for us, we've
learned that they suck at turning land, food, and water
([which is already scarce][water-scarcity]) into meat.

This inefficiency gets me stoked. It's good for both animals and for us. It gives us
incentive to stop killing animals _and_ make better use of Earth's limited resources.
We've pushed factory farming to its extremes and proved it won't work, so now we're
forced to consider alternative production methods.

This is necessary keep up with the growth in demand for meat as economies around
the world strengthen and more people can afford meat. It's a great example of
how constraints help to inspire innovation.

I'm excited to start eating [cultured meat][memphis-meats], or products like the
Beast Burger created by [Beyond Meat][beyond-meat] (so cool, read about
[how its made][beyond-meat-feature]). The one thing I'm kind of annoyed about is that in Canada, these
kinds of products aren't as available yet.

Fingers crossed that changes soon.

Either way, since October I now have one simple rule that I follow: **I don't
buy food that was once an animal**. I don't vote with my dollars for animals to
be raised and slaughtered. I think it's a dated approach to meat production with
negative impacts on our health and our environment.

Besides, killing animals sounds pretty shitty.

What do you think?
