Bill and Melinda gates write an open letter every year about what major problems
they want to work on solving. [This year's letter][gates-letter] truly
inspired me! They wrote it from the perspective of which super power they wish
they had that they could share with others. I loved Melinda's section
about _time_.

She writes about the unequal distribution of time spent on unpaid work and how
it perpetuates gender inequality _everywhere_ in the world. Then she shows how
the triangle kitchen design drastically reduced the number of steps required in
the kitchen for a person to bake a cake (as an example).

The result of this design was that it created _new_ time for women to participate
in social and civic discourse.

That's what got me excited. The idea of creating new time for people to
focus on the things that are most important to them, where they can contribute
the most possible value to their communities.

Right now we're standing in front of a giant wave of new products and
services that will automate so many drudge tasks. It's going to enable so
many new civic and social participants.

Awesome!
