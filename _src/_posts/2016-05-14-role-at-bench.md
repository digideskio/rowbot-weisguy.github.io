It feels a bit weird being referred to as an 'engineer' since I don't have a
computer science degree, but hey, that's what you can call me now.

I start at Bench on May 24th as a front-end software engineer! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to start working with the team to take bookkeeping and accounting
off the list of daily worries for entrepreneurs and small business owners across
the US (and hopefully Canada one day, too).

I wrote a [previous post][saving-time] that explains why I like their product.
I want to free entrepreneurs to focus on what makes their business tick.

Bookkeeping and accounting is a major headache for people, so if you can take
that off peoples' plates, hopefully they're enabled to participate and
contribute to the development of their businesses in more meaningful ways.

Stoked!
