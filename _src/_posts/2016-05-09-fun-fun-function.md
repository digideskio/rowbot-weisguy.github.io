If you are a beginner to intermediate programmer like me, you&rsquo;ve got to
check out the [funfunfunction][fun-fun-function] YouTube channel.

**Protip: watch his videos in order!** The videos will make the most sense when
you watch them sequentially.

I love how he breaks down the underlying principles that power a lot of modern
JavaScript libraries and frameworks. If you don&rsquo;t have a rigorous
computer science background, this sort of thing is very useful.

Here&rsquo;s one of my favourites:

> Great software is built by great teams, not great developers.

What a guy!
