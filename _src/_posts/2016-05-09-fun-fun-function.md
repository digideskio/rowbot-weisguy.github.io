If you are a beginner to intermediate programmer like me, you&rsquo;ve got to
check out the [funfunfunction][fun-fun-function] YouTube channel.

Here&rsquo;s one of my favourite videos:
<div class="video">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnCeaJdd_sY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

**Protip: watch it from the beginning!** His videos make the most sense
when you watch them sequentially.

I love how he breaks down the underlying principles that powers a lot of modern
JavaScript libraries and frameworks right now. I didn't go deep on computer
science during my education, so this kind of content is _huge_ for me.

On that note, if you have any recommendations you can throw out there for
these kinds of resources, please let me know in the comments below. ðŸ‘‡
