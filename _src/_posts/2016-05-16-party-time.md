In my hasty decision to kill my darlings and just publish a damn site to play
with, I neglected the visitors that depend on me to bring the party. This just
goes to show that you and your site visitors are not always on the same page
about what your website should do.

Well, I fucked up. **The party feature is back!** ðŸŽ‰

Long live the party.

Enjoy some obligatory Andrew W.K.
