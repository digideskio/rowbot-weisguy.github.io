I learned tonight that I have a pet peeve: developers saying they're self taught.

One does not simply open a text editor and start writing code.

The more likely reality was that they tapped into a vast library of web resources:
Stack Overflow answers, dev blogs, open sourced code... there's so much good stuff.
The many web authors who not only take the time to share what they've learned,
but to teach as well.

Anyway, if ever you've taken the time to use the web to teach something, thank you! 👏
