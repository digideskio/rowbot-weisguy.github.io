I'm feeling pretty damn good right now. ðŸŒž

I had my last hiring interview this afternoon with a tech company in Vancouver
that I've been talking to for almost a year. They made an offer! A good offer!
I'm quite excited about working them!

It's not official yet (I haven't signed anything) but I'm gonna go ahead and
give myself a pat on the back for holding out for so long in this job search. I
have talked to many companies trying to develop opportunities and at one point
not too long ago, I was feeling really discouraged.

One company shared with me a salary range that seemed reasonable, but then made
an offer to me that was below even the lowest number on their range. I know it's
just business, but it felt insulting.

I started thinking I was being a bit too precious about my skills, since I was
trying to find a fit somewhere that would value me as a designer _and_ as a
developer.

But I think it might have worked out. Onto a new chapter with its own struggles.
